# XR4ALL Survey

This survey was conducted to gather some data from potential users for a project that was in development.

The project was to create a technical and business plan for a Unity plugin that would allow VR and AR developers to easily incorporate heart rate data (for example, from a smart watch) into an application, or save it for later for analysis. This theoretically allows insight into the user's excitement levels at specific times when using the application.

The survey sought to inform development of the plugin by gauging the interests of potential users on key questions.

I played around with donut plots, but bar plots seemed to display the results most clearly.

The overall output can be seen in the .pdf file (R Markdown output). The plots (.jpg files) are easiest to view after downloading.
